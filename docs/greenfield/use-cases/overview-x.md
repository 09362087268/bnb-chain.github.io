# Showcases in Labs

The goal of the BNB Greenfield platform is to unleash the power of decentralized blockchain and storage technology on data ownership and data economy.

This part of the documentation on BNB Greenfield is neither accurate as industrial designs nor serious as academic research. It just lists a few potential showcases that can be modeled upon BNB Greenfield in a "laboratory environment". The showcases are used to inspire further experimentation and solid design to create the next generation of decentralized applications.

## From Showcases to Real Production

Different big and small showcases are in this section. Some of them may be worth to be implemented into a real application, but more are expected to inspire new models to be invented to unleash the power of BNB Greenfield. _This part of the documentation is
expected to be soon substituted by real applications in production.
