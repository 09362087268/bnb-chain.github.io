Greenfield?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#what-is-greenfield" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Greenfield is a protocol that provides core primitives, enabling a programmable, trustless decentralized storage network, parallel and interchangeable to traditional cloud storage services.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="what-is-the-connection-between-greenfield-and-bnb-smart-chain">What is the connection between Greenfield and BNB Smart Chain?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#what-is-the-connection-between-greenfield-and-bnb-smart-chain" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Greenfield and BNB Smart Chain (BSC) are two separate, complementary protocols, both created by BNB Chain community. Greenfield allows users to ‚Äúlogin‚Äù, create, own, and trade their data assets at another level of freedom, and what is more, embrace another level of transparency on how their data is owned and used. Greenfield is designed to be an economically self-sustained, service-oriented ecosystem. The real power of the ecosystem will lie in that the platform is not only designed to store the data, but also to support the creation of value based on  the data assets and its related economy.</p><p>BSC, on the other hand, is the complete EVM-supported blockchain to support general applications. The way BSC and Greenfield are connected through the set of relayers to enable programmability features around the data stored on Greenfield. As such, developers are able to write smart contracts on BSC which will manage the storage on the Greenfield.  </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="what-are-examples-of-value-that-can-be-created-from-data-assets-stored-on-greenfield">What are examples of value that can be created from data assets stored on Greenfield?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#what-are-examples-of-value-that-can-be-created-from-data-assets-stored-on-greenfield" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Greenfield introduces a concept of programmable storage - all fully on-chain. This capability opens up a myriad of use cases beyond simple storage, which couldn&#x27;t have been possible before. For example, applications like site hosting, content delivery (CDN), document management, file sharing, and many more now can be implemented in fully decentralized ways - without any specific centralized authority. This means that if a particular company shuts down or lays off thousands of employees, the quality of service the users receive will not be affected.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="what-advantages-does-greenfield-have-over-traditional-hosted-storage-services">What advantages does Greenfield have over traditional hosted storage services?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#what-advantages-does-greenfield-have-over-traditional-hosted-storage-services" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Greenfield doesn‚Äôt position itself as a competitor of GCP/AWS/Azure, but rather extension of capabilities. Since the Greenfield provides APIs and concepts that are very similar to traditional hosted storage API, this will allow existing cloud storage customers to extend the existing storage-only features with the programmable decentralized data-sharing capabilities, in a plug-n-play fashion.</p><p>As Greenfield is based on decentralized data-sharing protocol, data and permissions are referenced in an open way. Data is referenced using identifiers that are unique to the data, making your data completely portable - accessible from Service Providers, which can be also traditional hosted storage services. </p><p>Data is backed up on Greenfield by utilizing different Storage Providers, in a decentralized manner. This means there is no single centralized service which holds the data. As such users may prefer Greenfield over traditional hosted storage service, if they want an additional layer of reliability and reassurance their data is also accessible and intact.</p><p>For instance, files that need to be accessed at any moment with no possible delay, it‚Äôs better to store on Greenfield as even if several Storage Providers fail, the built-in redundancy mechanism still ensures files can be accessed at any time.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="what-advantages-does-greenfield-have-over-other-decentralized-services">What advantages does Greenfield have over other decentralized services?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#what-advantages-does-greenfield-have-over-other-decentralized-services" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Greenfield was designed as an open-source, cloud-native, highly scalable decentralized storage. Over the years, there were a lot of storage solutions, introduced by the blockchain community. Some are good, some need improvement. BNB Chain has assembled a team of data and blockchain architects and given them a carte blanche - focus on creating new value, rather than on marginal protocol and engine optimisations of the existing storage protocols.</p><p>This is how the journey of Greenfield started to address the increasing adoption of decentralized storage, taking the best features of the existing solutions, while not being limited by the historical architectural decisions. The decision to provide a full suite of web2 storage look and feel was a must and a prerequisite, as the vision of Greenfield doesn‚Äôt limit itself to be only used by the decentralization enthusiasts, but also adopted by the enterprise customers. As such, features like federation, authorisation, permissioning, type-based SLA and many others cemented their place in the product backlog, extended by the decentralized programmability.</p><p>As a result, Greenfield is designed to give strong performance and reliability regardless of how much data is being stored on it, meaning both enterprise and retail customers can rely on it - both for initial adoption and massive projects. </p><p>This is very different from other decentralized storage, which are plagued by the latency and availability concerns. As Greenfield specifically incentivises Storage Providers on the serving side, will result in high quality service and sustainable ecosystem for the long run. Storage Providers form a white-listed P2P network to communicate with each other to ensure data availability and redundancy. There will also be a P2P-based upload/download network across SPs and user-end client software to facilitate anti-censorship and fast data transfer.</p><p>Furthermore, through atomic integration with BSC, the platform provides a fully programmable EVM-based environment, to create a variety of use-case around data. These may include, but definitely not limited to, use-case such as content sharing, continuous integration and development (CI/CD) tools, video hosting etc. - all fully decentralized and on-chain.</p><p>The vision behind Greenfield is not to be just another decentralized storage solution, but to become an economically self-sustained, service-oriented ecosystem. The real power of the ecosystem will lie in that the platform is not only designed to store the data, but also to support the creation of value based on  the data assets and its related economy. </p><p>Under the hood, Greenfield is a decentralized storage network that atomically integrates with BSC Ethereum Virtual Environment (EVM) and asset landscape, to execute smart contracts and manage storage and retrieval operations on the network - Greenfield VM. </p><p>The atomic integration with BSC enables the execution to be fast, secure, and efficient, and it offers a number of advantages compared to other virtual machines and solutions. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="ipfs">IPFS<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#ipfs" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><p>By itself, IPFS is not usable out of the box, as the service doesn‚Äôt require replication, long-term storage and SLA. As such, when users choose to use IPFS, and want a reliable service, are forced to augment the application with additional interaction and logic with a 3rd party pinning service, such as Pinata.</p><p>On the other hand, Greenfield encapsulates all the underlying scalability architecture, abstracting the complexity of the decentralized protocol. This way users can focus on feature creation, rather than technology integration.</p><p>Greenfield also provides programmability capabilities, which makes it more than just storage service.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="filecoin">Filecoin<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#filecoin" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><p>Filecoin improves on the IPFS drawbacks and provides built-in incentivising capabilities for improved reliability. Similarly to Greenfield, it should also support programmability features, through FVM, which is scheduled in Q1 2023.</p><p>There are several differences between the platforms, basing on which users should take into account to understand which fits them the best.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="usability">Usability<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#usability" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><p>Compared to WebAssembly (WASM), EVM provides ample built-in support for blockchain features, such as smart contracts, and cryptographic functions, where EVM excels and is specifically designed for executing these types of operations. In addition, EVM has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, which can make it easier to build complex enterprise-grade applications. A variety of tools for debugging and testing, makes it the best environment for decentralized application development to ensure the reliability and security of the code.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="performance">Performance<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#performance" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><p>The integration with BSC is optimized for executing storage and retrieval operations, which are central to the Greenfield network. It is designed to be fast and efficient, with low overhead and high throughput. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="strong-ecosystem">Strong ecosystem<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#strong-ecosystem" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><p>The EVM is a battle proven massively used execution environment deeply rooted in the most used blockchains like Ethereum and BSC. By making Greenfield E\MV-compatible, we‚Äôve given all the decentralized applications (dApp) community the tools to add built-in, on-chain storage capability - unleashing the myriad of use cases and new capabilities on the existing projects loved by millions around the globe. As such, all EVM-based decentralized applications can use the same well-proven libraries and team skills to add more features and quickly bring added value to its users.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="web3storage">Web3.storage<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#web3storage" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><p>Web3.storage is a consumer facing decentralized storage, natively based on IPFS and Filecoin protocols to store and access data. It‚Äôs a good product in the consumer storage domain and provides capabilities competing with similar applications in the sphere, such as Google Drive and Dropbox.</p><p>While the service provides good capabilities for basic retail users, it lacks more advanced features needed for enterprise-level customers, as well as programmability.</p><p>As such, Greenfield doesn‚Äôt compete with Web3.storage and they serve completely different markets.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="arweave">Arweave<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#arweave" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h4><p>Since the vision of Greenfield is to become a production-based storage system, where data usage frequently changes, the Greenfield billing system is identical to the one of traditional hosted storage services. This way users pay low fees for storage as well as for usage of the data.
This is very different, both conceptually and architecturally, to the Arweave billing system, where users pay a high one-time fee for future unlimited usage.</p><p>Also, similarly to IPFS, Arweave doesn‚Äôt provide any guarantees of SLA, so in order to use it in the production environment, users should integrate 3rd party scaling solutions into the application, such as Bundlr.</p><p>Overall, given Arweave‚Äôs long-term payment and lack of programmability capabilities, makes it a very good fit for storing archive data - an important, but different target from the Greenfield‚Äôs vision perspective.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="tokenomics-of-bnb-greenfield">Tokenomics of BNB Greenfield<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#tokenomics-of-bnb-greenfield" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>One thing users need to be aware of is tokenomics of the projects. Each of the previously described projects use their own token, which solely serves as a unity token of the particular project. </p><p>This is very different from Greenfield, which uses BNB token as the utility token. One of the unique benefits of the BNB token is that it has limited supply, which means no one can create more BNB tokens, just to prop their balance sheet. Moreover, BNB token is also deflationary and is being periodically burned, or moved out of circulation, during the block creation of the BNB Smart Chain. Lastly, BNB token is used for all the projects within the BNB Chain ecosystem, including all the rollup and scaling solutions.</p><p>All these make BNB token extremely versatile, having no correlation with any specific domain, and ideal for financial project planning and COGS predictability.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="will-it-be-cheaper-to-store-data-on-bnb-greenfield-than-other-centralized-cloud-services">Will it be cheaper to store data on BNB Greenfield than other centralized cloud services?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#will-it-be-cheaper-to-store-data-on-bnb-greenfield-than-other-centralized-cloud-services" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>As Greenfield is a free market, the price will be determined by a number of variables related to the supply and demand for storage. It‚Äôs difficult to predict before launch. However, a few design elements of the network help support inexpensive storage.</p><p>The design prefers simplicity first principle over other considerations. Simple solutions are not only easy to implement, run, maintain, and extend, but also friendly to software performance, which is a main goal of the design. For example, any computing-intensive proof, like what Filecoin adopts, is ruled out according to this principle. </p><p>The biggest lesson learned from the crypto industry and BNB ecosystem is that the community has the most talent and power to build more applications and infrastructure in different self-driven ways.  The design should focus on the core platform and technical foundation that provide enough interface, tools, and other facilitation to the developer community to build upon them. </p><p>The economy targets beyond the existing BNB Chain clients, but also traditional Web2 users and developers. The system design should try to be as compatible as possible with popular Web2 and Web3 standards. </p><p>Further, Greenfield introduces a concept called Service Providers. There will be many Service Providers offering different prices, based on region and need SLA. We expect Greenfield‚Äôs permissionless and programmable model to result in very efficient operations with inherently added value provided by the built-in programmability.</p><p>Servicer Providers will provide publicly accessible APIs for users to upload and manage data. These APIs are very similar to AWS S3 APIs, so that existing developers may feel familiar enough to write code for it - and result with little cost to update the application with Greenfield programmable capabilities and build superior products for the users.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="who-owns-users-data-and-who-has-access-to-it">Who owns users&#x27; data and who has access to it?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#who-owns-users-data-and-who-has-access-to-it" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Data resources on Greenfield, such as the data objects and the buckets, all have access control, such as which address can create, read, list, or even execute the resources, and which address can grant/revoke these permissions.</p><p>Only the user who initially uploaded the data is considered as sole owner of the data. Data objects can be only read and downloaded by the other users with proper read permissions.</p><p>Unlike IPFS and other storage systems, only authorized users can access the data - even if they have the url link to the data. Owners can later revoke the permissions to anyone, effectively removing the access rights.</p><p>Also, proof of existence challenges, which validators perform on the data, is done on the sector level - that is small pieces of data of a particular file. As such, no entity besides the specifically authorized parties can access the full file.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="will-users-be-able-to-privately-store-and-delete-items-from-greenfield">Will users be able to privately store and delete items from Greenfield?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#will-users-be-able-to-privately-store-and-delete-items-from-greenfield" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>By design, the bytes that are stored and downloaded later for the object are exactly the same bytes that were originally uploaded and cannot be altered. Users may choose their own encryption scheme if they want the data to be unrecognizable by Service Providers or any others, even though Service Providers have the obligation to not circulate these data out of users‚Äô instruction.</p><p>Only the metadata is stored as the state data on the blockchain, the actual data is stored by Service Providers. Once a user wishes to delete their items, the metadata is deleted, which can be verified on blockchain, as such state removal will change the hashroot of the state.</p><p>Unlike other decentralised solutions, where there cannot be a guarantee that all copies of the file are gone from the network, Greenfield provides a cryptographic proof of the deletion process by the Service Provider, ensuring that the data is no longer stored on the network. </p><p>This design ensures that users have full control over their data, making the system fully compliant with various privacy policies, including GDPR .  </p><p>Unlike other decentralized solutions, where there cannot be a guarantee that all copies of the file are gone from the network, Greenfield provides an explicit acknowledgement of the deletion process by the Service Provider, ensuring that the data is no longer stored on the network. This design ensures that users have full control over their data, making the system fully compliant with various privacy policies.</p><p>We at BNB Chain believe that a decentralized, know-nothing approach to data storage offers far better security than traditional, centralized approaches. However, many older data security and privacy standards (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), require making specific representations about the physical location of data (e.g, requiring that data only be stored in certain countries or in data centers that meet certain standards). Therefore, if your application is subject to those standards, you should make sure that BNB Greenfield is right for you. </p><p>BNB Greenfield roadmap includes a project around geotagging and making sure that data only goes to nodes in certain countries. As the list of Storage Providers operators includes both individuals and data centers, once there is a critical mass of Storage Providers operators who are operating compliant data centers, we also intend to add an option for customers to only store data on nodes in compliant data centers should they need to meet storage compliance requirements. However, neither of these two important capabilities for compliant storage is live as of the last publication date.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="how-does-the-sharing-data-mechanism-work">How does the Sharing Data mechanism work?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#how-does-the-sharing-data-mechanism-work" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>BNB Greenfield has implemented a very secure and highly flexible mechanism for sharing files, portions of folders, etc., relying on the blockchain mechanism.  An Access Grant is a security envelope that contains a Service Provider address, a restricted authorization token, and a restricted path-based encryption key‚Äîeverything an application needs to locate an object on the network, access that object, and decrypt it. Access Grants coordinate two parallel constructs‚Äîencryption and authorization-- in a way that makes it easy to share data without having to manage access control lists or use complex encryption tools. Both of these constructs work together to provide a client-side access management framework that‚Äôs secure and private, as well as extremely flexible for application developers.</p><p>Since the underlying technology is based on blockchain signatures, there are no security implications in the choice of creating access grants in the command line interface vs. the browser interface. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="how-is-the-overall-system-security-of-bnb-greenfield-is-ensured">How is the overall system security of BNB Greenfield is ensured?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#how-is-the-overall-system-security-of-bnb-greenfield-is-ensured" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>The data integrity should be first guarded by the checksum of the objects as well as by the cryptographic signatures of the user. So when the user uploads the file, the user signs the file metadata, including the file checksum. As a result, no actor, including the Storage Providers, cannot change both the files and the checksum. The checksum is part of the data object metadata, and is verified constantly by the Greenfield validators.</p><p>The overall security of the system is ensured by the underlying security of the blockchain, on which all the interaction is managed. The off-chain communication between the Storage Providers is also based on the battle proven Tendermint SDK p2p protocol ensuring the battle proven security according to the most strict industry standards.</p><p>In general, data stored on Greenfield can be considered more secure, compared to existing traditional data storage providers, as access is secured by cryptographic elements - which are much more resistant to security attacks than cloud Single-sign-on (SSO) membership management. Overall, blockchain-backed security adds an additional layer of security, versus both traditional cloud-based and decentralized storage, that can help to prevent unauthorized access and protect against threats such as malware and other attacks. </p><p>By providing a secure and reliable way to store and process sensitive data and code, Greenfield can help to prevent unauthorized access and tampering, which can be a major concern in decentralized storage networks.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="are-there-any-single-points-of-failure-spof">Are there any Single Points of Failure (SPOF)?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#are-there-any-single-points-of-failure-spof" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>BNB Greenfield is designed to be extraordinarily resilient to data loss. The decentralized nature of our Storage Providers provides exceptional resilience against a lot of things that cause data loss in conventional storage systems (IT failure, fire, floods, power outages, etc.). The infrastructure automatically provides replication among the primary and secondary Storage Providers to store data segments replicas and their EC parity pieces.</p><p>In addition, data metadata is held on-chain using the BNB Greenfield blockchain, where the integrity is ensured by the consensus protocol - similarly to BNB Smart Chain. Thus, the integrity of the data is fully ensured by the decentralization of both the storage as well as the metadata layer.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="is-bnb-greenfield-compatible-with-popular-cli-tools">Is BNB Greenfield compatible with popular CLI tools?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#is-bnb-greenfield-compatible-with-popular-cli-tools" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>An important aspect of BNB Greenfield is compatibility with the existing, de facto standard for cloud object storage, AWS S3. As S3 is a vast, 15-year-old API, while we have aimed to support the most important capabilities---which cover the overwhelming majority of cloud storage-based applications--there is a long tail list of lesser-used functions that are not yet supported. </p><p>The end goal is to provide 100% compatibility and our next major effort involves supporting a range of server-side S3 functions. We listen to the community and users when prioritizing additional S3 functionality.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="how-can-i-contribute-to-the-design-and-implementation-of-the-bnb-greenfield">How can I contribute to the design and implementation of the BNB Greenfield?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#how-can-i-contribute-to-the-design-and-implementation-of-the-bnb-greenfield" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>BNB Chain always pursues the best system for the community and the overall blockchain ecosystem. Of course, BNB Greenfield design is not 100% final and the community still has work to do based on the feedback from the validators, storage providers, and of course the users.
This document is intended to address the known limitations of the technology with regard to security, performance, availability, usability, tokenomics, and more. The main purpose of this document is for the users and community members to understand the design choices and make well-informed decisions.
Important to note, that while as with every software product, some compromises have been made, everything is open for discussion and if you strongly disagree with the made architectural choices, please do raise your concerns in the github development page and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/bnbchain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discord channel</a>. As with other BNB Chain systems, BNB Greenfield is open-source. We also publish detailed whitepapers, and frequent technical updates, so you can see what it is we are doing. This includes public access to github issues, including bugs, the internal roadmap, and everything although the internal discussion process. and we strongly encourage wider participation both in the discussion and the implementation process.</p><p>Read more FAQs related to <a href="/docs/greenfield/faqs/validators">Greenfield validators</a> and <a href="/docs/greenfield/faqs/storage-providers">Greenfield Service Providers</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="dont-see-your-question">Don&#x27;t see your question?<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#dont-see-your-question" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>We&#x27;re working on expanding this FAQ with more content, including questions from the community and partners, so please watch this space!
