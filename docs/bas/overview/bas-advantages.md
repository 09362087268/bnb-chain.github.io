# Advantages of BAS

The BNB Chain ecosystem is comprised of 2 blockchains - the Beacon Chain (BC) and the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). BC is the governance layer of the ecosystem whereas, BSC is the financial hub where the actual development comes into action which includes decentralized applications related to DeFi, Metaverse, GameFi, etc.  Over the years, BSC has grown into becoming the developers' favourite blockchain ecosystem for building various powerful decentralized applications that are shaping the Web3 ecosystem. However, with the increase in the network usage and users, network scalability issues are surfacing to overcome this constraints and provide their users with seamless services the BNB Chain team has introduced the BNB Application SideChain (BAS).

Some of the major advantages of BAS includes:

* **Overcoming networsk scalability issues**: sidechains are designed for much higher throughput and lower (even zero) gas fees. 

* **Ready-to-Use Solutions**: in the form of BAS, we provide ready-made solutions to the developers making intergration with BSC much more easier. 

* **Build and Expand Eixisting Functionality of BSC**: BAS is a lightweight framework on which one can build simple but functional blockchain projects. Developers and teams can create simple blockchains with their own business rules and economies. Most importantly, they can extend the existing functionality of the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). The idea of BAS is to allow you to expand and reuse existing modules, and by using the architecture on smart contracts, painlessly modify existing contracts.
   
* **Validators Provided by BSC**: It is an infrastructure to help developers and node operators build and run their own blockchains as their internal value system and for a massive number of users while still maintaining a close connection with the BSC by using the consensus mechanism (validators) of the BSC ecosystem.
